# realtime_video_stream_task 🎬📲

A Flutter project for video streaming with real-time events and push notification handling.

## Overview 🌟

This project allows streaming videos from **YouTube** or a **server-hosted source**, integrating **real-time events** through WebSockets and handling **push notifications**. Notifications can directly open the video screen, and the app updates like counts 👍 and viewer events 👀 in real-time.

The architecture follows a clean pattern with **Repository → DataSource → Cubit**, **dependency injection**, and **GoRouter** for navigation.
